# [Member based indexing](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-solr-member-permissions)

By default, indexing of permissions is based on groups. If you want or need member specific, say, for each member
the index should check if the permission is correct, you'll need the [Member based submodule](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-solr-member-permissions).

## IMPORTANT

This submodule is work in progress
